    "The median is the middle value in the dataset, such that half of the values are greater than or equal to the median, and the other half are less than or equal to the median. The median is less sensitive to outliers than the mean and is a better measure of central tendency for skewed distributions.\n",

    "<p>Outliers are extreme values that differ significantly from the other values in a dataset. They can have a significant impact on measures of central tendency and dispersion:</p>\n",
    "<ol>\n",
    "<li>\n",
    "<p>Measures of central tendency: Outliers can greatly affect the mean, but have little effect on the median and mode. This is because the mean is sensitive to extreme values, and outliers can pull it towards the extreme end of the distribution. For example, consider a dataset of salaries for a company that looks like this:</p>\n",
    "<p>30,000, 35,000, 40,000, 45,000, 50,000, 55,000, 60,000, 75,000, 100,000</p>\n",
    "<p>The mean salary is (30,000+35,000+40,000+45,000+50,000+55,000+60,000+75,000+100,000) / 9 = 54,444. The outlier of 100,000 has pulled the mean towards the upper end of the distribution.</p>\n",
    "</li>\n",
    "<li>\n",
    "<p>Measures of dispersion: Outliers can greatly affect measures of dispersion such as range, variance, and standard deviation. For example, consider the same salary dataset as above. The range of salaries is 100,000 - 30,000 = 70,000. However, if we remove the outlier of 100,000, the range becomes 60,000 - 30,000 = 30,000. Similarly, the variance and standard deviation will be larger if the dataset includes an outlier.</p>\n",
    "</li>\n",
    "</ol>\n",
    "<p>In summary, outliers can greatly affect measures of central tendency and dispersion, and it is important to identify and handle them appropriately in statistical analysis.</p>\n",
